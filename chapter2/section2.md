# Section 2

## 1. Express the function n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n + 3 in terms of O-notation.

    O(n^3)

## 2. Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in â€šO-notation.

    for i=0 to A.length
        min = -1
        for j=i to A.length
            if min == -1 or A[j] < A[min]: 
                min = j
        
        swap A[i] and A[min]
    
    This algorithm maintains that i > 0 and i < A.length inside the loop and j > i and j < A.length inside the inner loop. It also maintains that at the end of the inner loop, j == A.length and at the end of the outer loop, i == A.length.

    Run time will always be O(N**2) in the best or worst case because it will check the array from i to n(length of array), N times to make sure it has the min element.

## 3. Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in O-notation? Justify your answers.

    All of the elements need to be checked if the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array. On average, half the elements will be checked, considering its equally likely to find it halfway through the search. In the worst case, all elements will be checked, as it could be the last element. On average, big-O will be O(n/2) and for the worst case, it will be O(n).

## 4. How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

    We can modify any algorithm to work best with a special-case to have a good best-case running time. Special-cases, such as checking if an array is empty or already sorted for sorting algorithms, guarantee us a good best-case run time.

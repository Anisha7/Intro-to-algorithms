# 1 Comparison of running times

# For each function f(n) and time t in the following table, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes f(n) microseconds.

# explainations
First recall that a microsecond is 10^âˆ’6 seconds. Hence, 
one second = 10^6 microseconds
one hour = 3600000000 = 3.6 * 10^9 microseconds
one month (assume a month has 30 days) = 2592000000000 = 2.592 * 10^12 microseconds
one century = 3110400000000000 = 3.1104 * 10^15 microseconds.
